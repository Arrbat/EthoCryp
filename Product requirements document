1. PRODUCT DEFINITION
----------------------
Ethnocrypt is an application that allows user to encrypt and decrypt files using a graphical interface.
The key features that need to be implemented are:
- Simple and user-friendly GUI interface
- Various encryption and decryption options
- Password and key manager built into the app
- Audit trail feature that logs all encryption and decryption activities
The audience is everyone who needs it.

It is planned to release the first working version of the project before the beginning of September 2024.


2. SETTING GOALS
----------------------
Generally main goal is to create stable and working app with features above until the end of the term.


3. ASSUMPTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS
----------------------
There are a number of problems that project will have to face, some of them:
- Technical Complexity: The product may encounter technical challenges which will be difficult to solve due to limited knowledge and experience
- User Experience and Interface Design: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface may pose a significant challenge
- Security Vulnerabilities:  Any security vulnerabilities in the encryption process or storage mechanisms could compromise user data and trust


4. SCOPE OF WORK
----------------------
First of all, the application must provide the ability to securely encrypt and decrypt files. Everything else is secondary.
There are no plans to do the following (for now):
- Similar to notes, task scheduler, etc.
- Complex design interface. It should be simple
- Various features not directly related to the application idea (synchronization with the cloud, text formatting, etc.)
- Cross-platform
